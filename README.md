# Predictive-Modeling-for-credit-risk-assessment

How to Use:

    Data Input: Ensure your dataset is in the same directory as the Python file, and it's named credit_data.csv. Replace 'target' with the actual name of your target variable in the dataset.
    Libraries: Install the required libraries if you don't have them using pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost.
    Execution: Run the Python file. The script will train multiple models, evaluate their performance using ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and print the results.

Customization:

    Modify the preprocessing steps if your data requires specific handling.
    Add hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV if you want to optimize the models further.
